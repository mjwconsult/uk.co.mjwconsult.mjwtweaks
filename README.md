# uk.co.mjwconsult.mjwtweaks

This is a collection of small but useful tweaks that I apply to all sites.

## Requirements

## Log API to get entries from civicrm_log
- log.get retrieves entries from civicrm_log.
- log.lastmodified gets the lastmodified details as an array for an entity ID and table.

## CSS Style changes
* A custom stylesheet css/adminimal.css is loaded so that the drupal adminimal theme works nicely with CiviCRM.

## Links
- The "Manage" link on contact case tab opens in a new tab.

## Case UI
A set of settings allows you to hide various UI elements in the Case UI.

## Mosaico

Customise the tinymce editor to set force_root_block = FALSE and add lists to style options.
